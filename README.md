# Machine Learning Labs for Digital Healthcare

## Overview

The **MachineLearning** repository contains exercises for the **Machine Learning class of Digital Healthcare** at the [St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/en/academic-studies-continuing-education/media-digital-technologies/digital-healthcare). It covers various topics related to machine learning, including Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, deep learning (using TensorFlow), generative AI, and foundation models.

### Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for students and practitioners interested in machine learning techniques. The exercises do not contain the solutions. They contain all the instructions necessary to complete the tasks. Automated checks (using assert statements) help you verify your solutions. The exercises are designed to be self-contained and can be completed without additional materials.

### Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/andijakl/MachineLearning.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

### Usage

The repository contains some complete examples that are explained and worked on during class:

1. **Example - iris with pytorch**: A complete example of a neural network using PyTorch to predict iris flowers, the classical hello world example of machine learning.
2. **Example - breast cancer with pytorch**: further extending neural network training with more added features, this time using the breast cancer dataset.
3. **Example - mnist with dense nn and pytorch**: Example of the mnist dataset (images of numbers from 0-9) using a dense neural network with PyTorch.
4. **Example - mnist with cnn and pytorch**: Similar to the previous example, but using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with PyTorch.

Explore the following labs within the repository:

1. **Lab 1 – Python, NumPy, and pandas**: Learn the basics of data manipulation and analysis using Python libraries.
2. **Lab 2 – Scikit-learn for heart disease prediction**: Apply machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease risk.
3. **Lab 3 – Deep learning for colorectal cancer detection**: Dive into neural networks and deep learning techniques based on TensorFlow.
4. **Lab 3b – Generative AI and Foundation Models with Amazon PartyRock**: Explore generative AI and prompt design through a no-code visual app editor at no cost.
